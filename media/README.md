Figure 1: Training and Validation Loss
-
Loss represents how far off the model’s predictions are from the true labels. As the model goes through epochs, the loss should decrease due to the model learning from its mistakes and updating its weights to better fit the data. This verifies that our model is not overfitting or underfitting to the training data, since both training and validation loss decrease smoothly together.

Figure 2: Training and Validation Accuracy
-
Model accuracy represents how often the model’s predictions match the true labels (overall model performance). As the model goes through epochs, the accuracy should increase due to optimization of weights and biases as the model learns patterns in the dataset.
